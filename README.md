# G2TM: Single-Module Graph-Guided Token Merging for Efficient Semantic Segmentation (VISAPP 2026)

Graph-Guided Token Merging (G2TM) is a lightweight one-shot module designed to eliminate redundant tokens early in the ViT architecture. It performs a single merging step after a shallow attention block, enabling all subsequent layers to operate on a compact token set. It leverages graph theory to identify groups of semantically redundant patches.

The code will be released with the article, in March 2026.
