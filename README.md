# g2tm
Graph-Guided Token Merging (G2TM) is a lightweight one-shot module designed to eliminate redundant tokens early in the ViT architecture. It performs a single merging step after a shallow attention block, enabling all subsequent layers to operate on a compact token set. It leverages graph theory to identify groups of semantically redundant patches.
